# Setup data directories

# Setup data directories

## Objective Alignment

The pipeline needs a place to store downloaded and processed data. This is the foundation for all subsequent pipeline steps.

## Scope

- Create `data/raw/` directory for downloaded source files
- Create `data/processed/` directory for clipped/enriched outputs
- Create `data/tiles/` directory for generated PMTiles
- Create `frontend/public/data/` directory for frontend static data
- Add `.gitkeep` files to keep empty directories in git

## Non-Goals

- Do not modify any pipeline scripts
- Do not download any data

## Implementation Plan

1. Create directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data/raw data/processed data/tiles frontend/public/data
   ```
2. Add `.gitkeep` files:
   ```bash
   touch data/raw/.gitkeep data/processed/.gitkeep data/tiles/.gitkeep frontend/public/data/.gitkeep
   ```
3. Update `.gitignore` to ignore data files but keep `.gitkeep`:
   - Check if `.gitignore` already has rules for `data/`
   - If not, add rules to ignore everything except `.gitkeep`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `data/raw/` directory exists
- [ ] `data/processed/` directory exists
- [ ] `data/tiles/` directory exists
- [ ] `frontend/public/data/` directory exists
- [ ] Each directory contains a `.gitkeep` file

## Verification Commands

```bash
ls -la data/raw data/processed data/tiles frontend/public/data
# Should show .gitkeep files in each
```

## Risks / Edge Cases

- None — this is a simple directory creation task

## Dependencies

- None — can start immediately

## Acceptance Criteria

data/{raw,processed,tiles}/ and frontend/public/data/ directories exist with .gitkeep files

## Notes

**2026-02-17T17:21:01Z**

Completed data directory setup. All directories created with .gitkeep files. Updated .gitignore to allow .gitkeep while ignoring data contents.
