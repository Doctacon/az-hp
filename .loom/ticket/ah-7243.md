# Replace BLM SMA with PAD-US land ownership

## Notes

**2026-02-23T00:05:20Z**

Replaced broken BLM SMA API with PAD-US 4.1 Arizona download. Solves all three issues: no 500 errors, standard FGDB format, complete coverage including BLM and State Trust land. Added tribal (BIA) support.

**2026-02-23T00:44:48Z**

Pivoted from PAD-US to BLM SMA FEATURES layers (20-29) because ScienceBase requires authentication for S3-stored files. Added ArcGIS→GeoJSON geometry conversion. Using 2x2 tiled bboxes for BLM and STATE layers due to 500 errors on full AZ bbox. Result: 126 land ownership features (BLM=14, STP=8, USFS=7, NPS=22, FWS=17, USBR=6, BIA=40, DOD=12).

**2026-02-23T03:34:33Z**

Starting work: Verifying BLM SMA FEATURES layers pipeline. Frontend already configured for BIA/Tribal land. Running download step to test the 2x2 tiled bbox approach for BLM and STATE layers.

**2026-02-23T03:59:47Z**

Pipeline verification complete.

**Results:**
- land-ownership.pmtiles: 34M (was ~12K before)
- 119 land ownership features from BLM SMA FEATURES layers (20-29)
- Feature breakdown: BLM=7, STP=8, USFS=7, NPS=22, FWS=17, USBR=6, BIA=40, DOD=12
- 1,354,828 enriched road segments with land status
- 1,569 hunt-relevant POIs

**Known limitation:** BLM and STATE layers still return 500 errors on some tiles, resulting in ~7 missing BLM features (7 vs expected 14). This is acceptable for now - tribal (BIA) land is now included.
