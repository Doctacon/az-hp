# Replace BLM SMA with PAD-US land ownership

## Notes

**2026-02-23T00:05:20Z**

Replaced broken BLM SMA API with PAD-US 4.1 Arizona download. Solves all three issues: no 500 errors, standard FGDB format, complete coverage including BLM and State Trust land. Added tribal (BIA) support.

**2026-02-23T00:44:48Z**

Pivoted from PAD-US to BLM SMA FEATURES layers (20-29) because ScienceBase requires authentication for S3-stored files. Added ArcGIS→GeoJSON geometry conversion. Using 2x2 tiled bboxes for BLM and STATE layers due to 500 errors on full AZ bbox. Result: 126 land ownership features (BLM=14, STP=8, USFS=7, NPS=22, FWS=17, USBR=6, BIA=40, DOD=12).
