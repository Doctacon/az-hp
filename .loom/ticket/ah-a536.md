# Fix BLM SMA data to include BLM and State Trust land

# Fix BLM SMA data to include BLM and State Trust land

## Problem
The BLM SMA (Surface Management Agency) data is incomplete. The current download has only 64 features (NPS, FWS, DOD, FS, USBR) but is missing the two most important land types for hunting access:
- BLM (Bureau of Land Management) land
- State Trust land

This causes all roads to show \`private_or_unknown\` land status, making the land ownership feature non-functional.

## Root Cause
The BLM ArcGIS REST API returns 500 errors for the BLM (layer 7) and STATE (layer 14) sub-layers.

## Possible Solutions
1. Try BLM layer with smaller bounding boxes (tile the state into quadrants)
2. Look for an alternative BLM SMA bulk download (Shapefile/GDB) from BLM GeoPlatform
3. Use PAD-US (Protected Areas Database) from USGS instead
4. Try a different BLM service endpoint

## Impact
Without BLM/State land data, the road access coloring feature is broken - hunters cannot see which roads are on public land.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] BLM land polygons are included in blm_sma_az.geojson
- [ ] State Trust land polygons are included in blm_sma_az.geojson
- [ ] Re-running enrich produces roads with correct land_status values
