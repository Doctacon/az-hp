Your job is to turn the objective + current state into a coherent sprint and a crisp backlog.\\n- First, read the run CHARTER to understand objective + historical direction.\\n- Then inspect current backlog + repo state enough to remove ambiguity (tickets + git status/log).\\n- Write a sprint brief INTO THIS assigned ticket (objective restatement, sprint focus, current state, plan, risks/unknowns).\\n- Create/refine sprint tickets directly (prefer `loom ticket create --parent <THIS_TICKET>`).\\n- Every ticket must include: scope/non-goals, step-by-step plan, acceptance criteria, verification commands (use `uv run ...` for Python), risks/edge cases, deps/ordering.\\n- Before you stop: update THIS assigned ticket with (1) the list of created/updated ticket IDs and (2) suggested ordering + parallelization.\\n- Then notify manager: `loom team send mapping-issues manager \\\"INVESTIGATOR_DONE worker=w1 ticket=ah-174b created=[...]\\\"`.\\n- Then stop. The manager will retire your pane.\\n\\nTicket payload (from Loom ticket) is available; follow acceptance criteria and dependencies.\\n{\\n  \\\"ticket\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": \\\"ah-174b\\\",\\n    \\\"title\\\": \\\"Sprint prep: map display fix\\\",\\n    \\\"status\\\": \\\"open\\\",\\n    \\\"priority\\\": 1,\\n    \\\"type\\\": \\\"task\\\",\\n    \\\"assignee\\\": \\\"Connor\\\",\\n    \\\"tags\\\": [\\n      \\\"sprint:map-display-fix\\\",\\n      \\\"fanout\\\"\\n    ],\\n    \\\"deps\\\": [],\\n    \\\"links\\\": [],\\n    \\\"external_ref\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"parent\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n    \\\"claimed_by\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"relationships\\\": {\\n    \\\"blockers\\\": [],\\n    \\\"blocking\\\": [],\\n    \\\"children\\\": [],\\n    \\\"linked\\\": []\\n  },\\n  \\\"body\\\": \\\"# Sprint prep: map display fix\\\\n\\\\nObjective:\\\\nthe localhost viewing via make dev-frontend is showing the legend, but no map whatsoever. the app is not complete until i can view the ultimate product\\\\n\\\\nSprint prep deliverable (fill this ticket in, then create tickets):\\\\n\\\\n## Sprint Brief\\\\n\\\\nWrite a short sprint brief that a cheaper worker model can follow.\\\\n\\\\nRequired sections:\\\\n- Objective restatement: ...\\\\n- Sprint focus (2-5 words): ...\\\\n- Why this sprint focus is the best next step: ...\\\\n- Current state:\\\\n  - Existing tickets that matter: ...\\\\n  - Codebase state that matters (git status/log, key modules): ...\\\\n- Risks + unknowns (and how we'll resolve them): ...\\\\n\\\\n## Ticket Set\\\\n\\\\nCreate the sprint tickets directly.
