  ┃  But the buildings file is huge (1.5GB geojson). Tippecanoe on that will take a long time. Let me try running just the tiles step again.                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                         
     The tiles step was interrupted. We have 4 of 5 pmtiles files generated, but buildings.pmtiles is missing and landcover.pmtiles seems very small (28KB for 171K features seems off)
