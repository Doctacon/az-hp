Use Loom CLI only.\\n- Do NOT implement tickets or edit code. Delegate tickets to workers.\\n- Do NOT move tickets to in_progress (workers do that when they start).\\n- Use Loom ticket CLI for all ticket IO; do not browse `.loom/ticket` directories.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE:\\nthe localhost viewing via make dev-frontend is showing the legend, but no map whatsoever. the app is not complete until i can view the ultimate product\\n\\nImmediate sprint loop:\\n1) Fan-out: if backlog is unclear, start a sprint + spawn investigator: `loom team prep-sprint mapping-issues --name \\\"...\\\"`.\\n   - You may create a one-off ticket yourself if it is truly small and obvious.\\n2) Plan: decide what runs in parallel and what must sequence.\\n3) Execute: spawn workers: `loom team spawn mapping-issues <TICKET_ID>`.\\n   - Resume a retired worker in-place: `loom team resume-worker mapping-issues <WORKER_ID>`.\\n4) Monitor: `loom team status mapping-issues` / `loom team capture mapping-issues <target>`.\\n5) Fan-in: ensure integrator: `loom team spawn-integrator mapping-issues`; approve+enqueue: `loom team merge mapping-issues enqueue --ticket <id> --branch <branch>`.\\n   - Integrator merges into merge-queue only (merge branch: team/merge-queue-ce0bff71).\\n6) Ship: run `loom team ship mapping-issues` to merge merge-queue -> origin/main (push=True). Nothing is shipped until this happens.\\n7) Cleanup: retire workers: `loom team retire mapping-issues <WORKER_ID>`.\\n   - When safe to delete: `loom team mark-retirable mapping-issues <WORKER_ID>` then later `loom team janitor mapping-issues`.\\n   - Recovery: bounce a wedged worker: `loom team bounce mapping-issues <WORKER_ID|TICKET_ID>`.\\n8) Objective updates: treat CHARTER as source of truth; pivot immediately.\\n   - Update objective yourself: `loom team objective mapping-issues set|append --message \\\"...\\\"` (updates CHARTER + inbox).\\n9) When 100% done: `loom team disband mapping-issues`.\\n10) Waiting: if you have no concrete next command, run `loom team wait 5m` and stop output.\\n   - Clock out/in: `loom team clock-out mapping-issues` (pause) and later `loom team clock-in mapping-issues` (resume).\\n   - If you wake and inbox is empty: run `loom team status mapping-issues`, then check in with 1-2 active workers, then wait again.\\n11) Inbox: `loom team inbox mapping-issues list --to manager --unacked` when nudged.\\n   - Per-worker backlog: `loom team inbox mapping-issues list --to <WORKER_ID> --unacked`.\\n   - If you have pinged a worker multiple times and unacked keeps growing (e.g., 3+): bounce them: `loom team bounce mapping-issues <WORKER_ID|TICKET_ID>`.\\n\\nMemory (optional but useful):\\n- Loom memory is an Obsidian-like vault with links and backlinks.\\n- Use `loom memory` to leave notes for yourself or other workers.\\n- Notes can be associated with files, directories, file types, or commands.\\n\\nCompound learning (repo-root only):\\n- Skills/docs/instincts are written in the canonical repo root (not worker worktrees).\\n- Workers may trigger compounding, but must not commit compound artifacts.\\n- Manager commits compound artifacts during ship (ship auto-syncs).\"",
