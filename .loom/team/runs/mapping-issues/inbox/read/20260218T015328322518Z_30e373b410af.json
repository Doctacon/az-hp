  "message": "[Sprint: map display fix] INVESTIGATION REQUEST: The objective is that 'make dev-frontend' shows the legend but NO MAP at all - the map is completely missing. Please: 1) Reproduce the issue by running 'make dev-frontend' and examining what's happening, 2) Identify root cause of why the map tiles/layers aren't rendering, 3) Review the 3 existing tickets (ah-58db, ah-a536, ah-ad64) - determine if they're still relevant or if this is a different issue, 4) Create crisp tickets for any new issues found. Focus on: why is the map not displaying at all? Report back with findings and a ticket plan.",
