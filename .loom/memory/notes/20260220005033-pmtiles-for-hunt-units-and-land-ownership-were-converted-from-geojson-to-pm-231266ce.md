title: "PMTiles for hunt-units and land-ownership were converted from GeoJSON to PMTiles via tippecanoe\
  \ in pipeline/04_generate_tiles.sh. Frontend App.jsx updated to load vector sources instead of geojson\
  \ sources. Note: land-ownership has geometry format issues (ArcGIS rings) causing empty PMTiles - addressed\
  \ in ah-d095."
